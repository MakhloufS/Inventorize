The goal of bachelor's work was to design and implement inventory system application for Android platform.
Application is able to download current inventory list from server and divide it into separate rooms.
The actual inventory lookup is performed by scanning the QR code, placed on the item, via mobile phone's embedded camera
and processing its content by the application.
Upon completion, the application is able to export results as a HTML report to server or locally to phone's SD-card
and send out email notifications.
